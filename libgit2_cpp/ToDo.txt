0[0]. Reorganize structure of classes so commit is created by repo on current branch and not by branch!!!
1[0]???.	Check every libgit fnc for error returned i.e. else if (GIT_EUNBORNBRANCH == res)<---- that seem to be bad design.

2[0].	-=- for freeing 
3[1].	Every libgit2 wrapper should have operator to convert to native libgit2
4[0].  Tests 
5[1]. Check if every c_guts is const

7[3]. check_for_error should be parametrized so the type of errors i.e. GIT_EEXIST can be passed and checked for
8[1]. check_for_error should be adapted so it can be applied in cases where ptr is returned
9[1]. Make every non_ptr git_class wrapper to inherit from Guts_Provider i.e. class Git_Diff_Options : public Guts_Provider<git_diff_options,false>
10[3] intrusive_ptr in place of shared?
